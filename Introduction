QUESTION 5: WRITE A FUNCTION
We add a Leap Day on February 29, almost every four years. The leap day is an extra, or intercalary, day and we add it to the shortest month of the year, February. 
In the Gregorian calendar three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:

The year can be evenly divided by 4, unless;
The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years.Source

Task 
You are given the year, and you have to write a function to check if the year is leap or not.

Note that you have to complete the function and remaining code is given as template.

Input Format:

Read y, the year that needs to be checked.

Constraints

Output Format:

Output is taken care of by the template. Your function must return a boolean value (True/False)

Sample Input

1990  
Sample Output

False  
Explanation

1990 is not a multiple of 4 hence it's not a leap year.

SOLUTION:
 def is_leap(year):
    leap = False
    if year % 400 == 0:
         return True
    if year % 100 == 0:
         return False
    if year % 4 == 0:
         return True
    return False
 
QUESTION 6: PRINT A FUNCTION
Read an integer .
Without using any string methods, try to print the following:
Note that "" represents the values in between.

Input Format 
The first line contains an integer .

Output Format 
Output the answer as explained in the task.

Sample Input
3
Sample Output
123

SOLUTION:
from __future__ import print_function
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input())
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        print(i , end ='')
